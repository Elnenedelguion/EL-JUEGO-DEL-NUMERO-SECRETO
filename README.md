*****************************************************************************************************
:point_right: This game is a challenge where you must guess a number from 1 to 10. Each time you make a guess, you are told whether the secret number is higher or lower than your choice. If you guess correctly, you are congratulated for doing it in a specific number of attempts. If not, you can keep trying until you run out of possibilities. Once all possible numbers have been attempted, the game automatically restarts, allowing you to play again.
